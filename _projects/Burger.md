# Cheese Burger

There is debate on who painstakingly birthed our favourite monumental flavor creation into existence. What really matters is that, at the end of the day, we can collectively relish in the sweet glory of it all. From beef-to-bun ratio, ‘how much is too much?’ cheese, and the careful alchemy of condiments, every cheeseburger is a small mountain of heaven.

Any day without a cheeseburger in it is a waste. You can find a _cheeseburger_ no matter where you go in the world, so you have no excuse to miss out on the glory that some people can only dream of. Step up to the plate. :burger:
